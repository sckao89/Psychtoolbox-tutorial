# Psychtoolbox-tutorial

Scott Kao

Sept-2025

For those who are new to this page, my name is Scott Kao, and I'm currently a Research Specialist at [Jenkins Lab](https://jenkins-lab.weebly.com/) @UPenn Psychology. 

I've been using MATLAB and Psychtoolbox to create experiments for a few years, and inspired by my friend [Moya](https://cocoyamo.github.io/), who wrote [this fabulous R tutorial](https://cocoyamo.github.io/R_tutorials/index.html), I decided that I should create something similar to document my learning and struggles of Psychtoolbox.

Before I begin, I just want to say thank you to [Prof. Tsai](https://psy.nccu.edu.tw/PageStaffing/Detail?fid=2896&id=340) from National ChengChi University. Have I not taken your experimental psychology course and the later became your TA for this course, I wouldn't have activeate my Asian SuperPower in coding (JK). 

So, this is a brief tutorial of how to design experiments using Psychtoolbox in MATLAB.
I will not explain too much about MATLAB basics (or I might add some in the future), but for now this will be focusing on Psychtoolbox basics. 

Feel free to leave any comments and suggestions. This is my frist time creating sth like this and I'm still constantly learning about MATLAB and Psychtoolbox. 

Thanks, 
Scott
